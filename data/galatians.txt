Paul, an apostle, not by men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead; and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia: grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
I am amazed that you have so soon been carried away from him who called you in the grace of Christ, to another gospel; because there is no other; unless there are some who are troubling you, and want to trun the gospel of Christ upside down. But although we, or an angel from heaven, proclaim anything else, except the Good News which has been preached to your, let him be accursed. For, just as we predicted, and I say now again; If anyone should come with any so-called gospel, except that which your received, let him be accursed. For do I now try to persuade men or God. Or do I seek to please men. If I was still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. For I want you to know, brothers, that the Gospel that I preached was not according to men; for neither did I receive it or learn it from men, but through the revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my former behaviour at one time in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure, and tried to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many of those of my age and generation, abounding more in zeal for the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through His grace, to reveal His son to me, that I should preach Him among the non-Jewish nations, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood, and neither did I go up to Jerusalem, to those who were apostles before me, but I went to Arabia, and then returned again to Damascus. Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him for fifteen days. I did not see any of the other apostles, except James, the Lord's brother. The things I am writing to you, before God, I do no lie. Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. I was unknown in appearance by the churches in Judea, which were in Christ, nevertheless, they had heard: "The one who at one time persecuted us, is now preaching the faith that he once tried to stamp out", and they glorified God because of me.

Then, after fourteen years, I went up to Jerusalem again, this time taking Barnabas and Titus with me. I went according to a revelation, to share with them the Gospel I was preaching among the Non-Jews. I spoke privately with those of reputation, to make sure that I was not running, or had not run in vain. But neither Titus, who was with me, although he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. But some false brothers sneaked in secretly to spy out the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, with the intention of driving us back into servitude. But we did not give in to them, or subject ourselves to them even for an hour, that the truth of the Gospel might remain with you.

But from those who seemed to be something - whatever they were at one time does not concern me; God is no respector of persons - that is to say, those who seemed to be in charge added nothing to my message. But, on the contrary, when they saw that the Good News to the Non-Jews had been entrusted to me, just as that of the circumcision to Peter - for he who worked in Peter the apostleship to the circumcision, was also working in me among the Non-Jews. When they recognised the grace which had been given to me, James, Cephas and John, all of whom seemed to be pillars, gave Barnabas and I the right hand of fellowship, with the understanding that we would go to the Non-Jews and they to the circumcision - only that we should remember the poor, the very thing I was also eager to do.

But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, for his behaviour was reprehensible. Before some came from James, he ate with the Non-Jews, but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews consented to this hypocracy, so that even Barnabas was mislead by their pretense. But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel, I said to Cephas in front of everyone: "If you, being a Jew, live as a Non-Jew and not a Jew, how is it that you are compelling the Non-Jews to live as Jews?"
